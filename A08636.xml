            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The very Title of a Poem even ſtartled at, and the worke itſelfe, to ſome ſcarce leſſe odious then a Libel. So great a miſchiefe hath licentious ſcribling, brought on that more excellent kind of writing. But this I leave unto the ſatyriſt. And that I may not bee thought cenſoriouſly arrogant to blame
<pb facs="tcp:14010:4"/>that act in others, which I may ſeeme my ſelfe to have committed; the Iudicious Reader may be pleaſed to take notice, that no vain deſire of praiſe, nor giddy humour to bee ſeen in print, hath thus brought me into publique view. But an humble, and modeſt hope, of rectifying the wrongs our Author hath ſuſtained through the rude attempts of a too-too buſie pen: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this was the chiefe and ſole cauſe of this publication (the worke having a long time lain by me:) yet will I not ſay, that herein I have wrought an actuall performance of the ſame; But the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe thereof, I leave to the cenſure of the conferring Reader. I am not ignorant of a ſort of curious ones, that looke for wonders from a tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: when indeed they ought rather to checke, and limit their expectation: far different is the caſe with one who in his courſe exſpatiates at randome, and with another, who is forc't to tread the ſteps of a fore-runner. Yet if they wil vouchſafe to
<pb facs="tcp:14010:5"/>come without prejudicate, and peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie opinions; they may herein meet with a ſtrictneſſe (ſuch as is requiſite) in the words, and a reſpective care towards the meaning of our Author; a ſweetneſſe too, asmuch as could conueniently be attained; having throughout obſerved a verſe for verſe traduction. For although in the Latine Elegiacke, that ſame <hi>In pedibus vitium</hi> be <hi>Cauſa decoris;</hi> Yet through the often cloſe of the <hi>Pentameter,</hi> the genuine, ſweet, and fluent ſtatelines of the Engliſh <hi>Decaſyllable,</hi> is much enerved. To plead my paines in the tranſlation, were a thing which I will not, nor cannot doe: ſince I never made it other then my recreation, my ſport. Though indeed the worke is ſuch as might well deſerve both a knowing, and a labouring Quill; and which that ſeldome erring critique, <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> hath thought good thus to cenſure. <hi>Epiſtolae omnium (Ovidii) librorum politiſſimae, nam &amp; ſententiae ſunt illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres facilitas, &amp; compoſita, &amp; numeri
<pb facs="tcp:14010:5"/>Poetici.</hi> If through my unskilfull copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I have any wayes impayred the worth and luſtre of the principall; ſo as it may now ſeeme unworthy of thoſe Elogies; yet through kind acceptance of this my firſt draught, &amp; a friendly advertiſement I ſhall hereafter endeavour to render it ſomewhat agreeable. For as I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne, and neglect, whatſoever proceeds from ignorance and detraction: ſo again, ſhal I alwayes be moſt ready (as <hi>Polyclete</hi> of old with his more curious peeces) to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend whatſoever the judicious cenſurer ſhall think worthy the correcting penſil.</p>
